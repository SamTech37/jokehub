# JokeHub
### What is it?
JokeHub is a website where you can posts joke and rate jokes, anonymously. 
### Why?
It's made by a Taiwanese high school student just for fun.  
Powered by React js.
### How it works?
You can browse jokes without logging in.  
Once you've logged in with Google (Facebook perhaps?), you can post and rate jokes.  
The authentication is used to identify users in order to prevent duplicated rates and other issues.  
Posting and rating is anonymous and we won't collect any of your personal information.

## Have Fun!
